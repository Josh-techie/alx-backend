# 0x01. Caching:

- As you explore this repository, you'll find a project that I've been working on. It focuses on the implementation of various caching algorithms, aiming to enhance your understanding and proficiency in caching systems. Together, we'll delve into the concepts of FIFO, LIFO, LRU, MRU, and LFU caching policies, learning their significance and application within software development. Through practical tasks and hands-on exercises, we'll explore the fundamentals of caching, its limitations, and its pivotal role in optimizing system performance. My goal is to offer you a structured approach to comprehend caching mechanisms, equipping you with essential skills for efficient data management and system optimization in backend development scenarios.
